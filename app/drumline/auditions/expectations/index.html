                <h1>Preparation</h1>
                <p>You need to be prepared if you expect to be a part of the Clemson Drumline. To be prepared, you need to get your binder ready with your audition materials as soon as they’re available online and <strong>commit to practicing</strong> as it will be necessary throughout the season. Study the music and other information, read and comprehend all of the print material such as the technique manual. Though we cannot ask you to do more than your best, other rising freshmen from around the country and veteran CUD members will also be auditioning for the same spot you are. You’ll want to do everything you possibly can to work hard and get ready for auditions. Spend as much time as you can playing on an actual drum so you don’t show up with “pad hands”. You also need to practice while marking time — working on your foot timing will help your hands. When you have questions, contact a CUD staff member — we’re here to help you. You can also arrange a one-on-one lesson.</p>

                <h1>Music &amp; Memorization</h1>
                <p>You should be thoroughly comfortable playing through every piece of music listed on the website. Start with the most fundamental exercises before moving to the cadences and the audition excerpt. In learning the music, make sure to play everything consistently correct (heights, dynamics, rhythms, etc) at a slower tempo first, then you can focus on increasing speed. We require that some of the audition material be memorized for auditions. Having something memorized is much more that just knowing “how it goes”, you must memorize all of the details on the page (dynamics, accents, sticking, measure number, etc.). Once your music is fully memorized you can begin to consider the following ensemble issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are you playing with your listening responsibility? (usually the person inside you on the line)</li>
                    <li>Are your feet in time?</li>
                    <li>How is your sound quality?</li>
                    <li>Where are you going on the field?</li>
                    <li>Are you using the correct technique?</li>
                    <li>How is your posture?</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article class="text fullWidth">
                <h1>Contribution</h1>
                <p>We want every single member to contribute to the level of excellence people expect out of the Clemson Drumline every weekend. To truly contribute to the group, you must learn to play well in an ensemble setting, not just as an individual. To be a good ensemble player, you must listen critically and adjust to whatever your listening responsibility is. It’s critically important to be aware of what is happening musically at all times. Contribution doesn’t just stop at playing. We want members that have a good personality and who are aware of things that are going on in the world around them. You should learn to anticipate things that are coming up; think ahead and know that you need to get your case out instead of having to be reminded, let your captain know that your sticks are getting worn down instead of letting them remind you, etc. Be proactive, not reactive. Every member of the ensemble is a leader in some capacity and should set an example for others. Help out your peers outside of rehearsal and contribute to smooth rehearsals by always being attentive and focused – if you have an important question, ask it, but if it can wait, don’t interrupt/derail rehearsal, because we want to spend every moment we can getting better and making music together. Our goal is to be the best drumline that we can be at all times. So ask yourself, what can you bring to CUD?</p>

                <h1>Technique</h1>
                <p>The Clemson Drumline technique is outlined in detail in the <a href="/auditions/#techniqueManuals">Technique Manuals</a>.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="text fullWidth">
                <h1>Timing &amp; Rhythmic Accuracy</h1>
                <p>The more you play with a metronome, the better your personal sense of timing will become without a metronome.  Practicing with a metronome is essential to developing timing skills and rhythmic integrity.  Start by fitting your feet to a metronome, then fitting your hands with your feet.  Building from the ground up will better translate what you practice into what you perform on the field.  Everyone’s individual timing must be strong to perform well as an ensemble. Rhythmic accuracy is the ability to play rhythms correctly in time and with clarity.</p>

            <article class="text fullWidth">
                <h1>Sight-Reading</h1>
                <p>Sight reading is an integral skill for college marching bands and there will be a sight reading component to your audition.  Unlike many high school band programs, we might perform up to 5 different shows and lots of stand tunes throughout the season - some of which will be learned in just a few rehearsals.  Better reading skills lead to less “learning” time and more “cleaning.” For assistance with sight-reading, try <a href="http://vicfirth.com/webrhythms/" target="_blank">Web Rhythms</a>!</p>
            </article>
            <article class="text fullWidth">
                <h1>Approach</h1>
                <p>You should approach the instruments as if you’re a professional musician. To act professionally you must show up prepared for every rehearsal. We’re looking for percussionists with a good attitude – team players who are not only willing, but eager to do what is best for the group. Team players embrace their role and put the interests of the drumline ahead of their own. When you play with the drumline, you should bring with you an air of confidence (but not arrogance) that is backed up by many hours of solid preparation. You should strive to always have a confident look (aggressive stance, good posture, confident facial expression) and a confident sound. When somebody watches you play, they should want to keep watching because there’s an intensity and passion to your look and sound. Good sound quality comes from letting the stick do the work. The stick, head, and drum should all speak to produce a relaxed and open sound. You should always want to produce the best sounds possible when playing any musical instrument, and marching percussion is no exception.</p>
